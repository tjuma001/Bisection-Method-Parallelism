# Bisection-Method-Parallelism
The Bisection method is a root finding algorithm that continuously cuts an interval in half until it finds and returns the root.  The downside with the bisection method is that it is generally considered to be slow, since the method must be iterated multiple times to find the root. So, the aim of the project was to use parallelism to reduce the amount of iterations required to find the root and reduce the time complexity of the algorithm.
